Trash_Wheel = read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 1, skip = 1) %>%
  select(-...15, -...16, -...17,
        Sports_Balls = "Sports Balls" ) %>%

```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15
    ## * `` -> ...16
    ## * `` -> ...17

The median number of sports balls in dumspters in the year 2018 was 4.

``` r
Trash_Wheel %>%
  filter(Year == 2018) %>%
  summarize(median_Sports_Balls = median(Sports_Balls))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   median_Sports_Balls
    ##                 <int>
    ## 1                   4

``` r
Precip_2018 = read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = 5, skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%

``` r

  bind_rows(Precip_2017, Precip_2018) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(year, month, total) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month])
```

The final trash dataset contained The final precipatation dataset
contained 24 rows of observations and 3 variables, including year,
month, and total precipitation. The total precipitation in 2018 was
70.33. The median number of sports balls in dumpster in the year 2018
was `Trash_Wheel %>% filter(Year == 2018) %>%
summarize(median_Sports_Balls = median(Sports_Balls))`.

## Problem 2

# Cleaning pols dataset

``` r
pols = (
  read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month],
    prez_gop = recode(prez_gop, '1' = "gop", '2' = "gop", '0' = "dem"),
    president = prez_gop) %>%
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day) %>%
  arrange(year, month)
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

# Cleaning snp dataset

``` r
snp = (
  read_csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    month = month.abb[month]) %>%
  select(-day) %>%
  select(year, month, close)
)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

# Cleaning unemployment dataset

``` r
unemployment = 
  read.csv("fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment rate") %>%
  rename(year = Year) %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>%
  arrange(year, month)
```

# Joining pols, snp, and unemployment datasets in “final”.

``` r
join1 <- left_join(pols, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
final <- left_join(join1, unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The pols-month dataset included information about which politicla party
held the presidential office, specified by month and year. It also
included data on the number of republican or democratic representatives
and senators were in office. The unemployment dataset showed unmployment
rates over time. After joining these datasets, there are 822 rows of
observations with 11 variables. The dataset was arranged to begin with
year and month, which can allow us to assess temporal trends in
unemployment rates not only throughout time, but categorized but which
and political party held the presidential office at the time.
Unemployment is used as a way to measure economic development or growth
(or lackthereof), and is therefore often used as a metric for
determining how successful a president is while in office.

## Problem 3

# Cleaning baby names dataset.

``` r
baby_names = read.csv("Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(
    birth_year = "year_of_birth",
    name = "child_s_first_name") %>%
  distinct()
```
